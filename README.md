Wings Without Oil

The Problem :

Birds which fare across the seas for migration and other birds which dwell along coasts have barbs and barbules in their feathers that lock together making the birds waterproof and bouyant. In the event of an oil spill, oil creeps up the barbules and forms clumps stopping them fromm interlocking which results in birds loosing their waterproofing ability. This causes cold water creeps up their feathers. They may also drown to due to the loss of bouyancy.

The Solution:


WingShield is an advanced Deep Neural Network (DNN) model designed to address the critical issue of birds inadvertently landing in ocean areas prone to oil spills. Developed with a strong commitment to environmental conservation, WingShield utilizes cutting-edge computer vision technology to detect the presence of birds in real-time and triggers an alarm system to prevent potential ecological disasters.

Key Features:

Bird Detection Precision:
WingShield employs a sophisticated convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, ensuring high accuracy in detecting avian species. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset containing various bird species commonly found near coastlines.

Real-time Monitoring:
The DNN model continuously analyzes live video feeds from strategically placed cameras along coastal regions or on bouys placed on the perimeter of the oil-spill region in the ocean . This real-time monitoring capability enables WingShield to promptly detect birds in the vicinity, preventing delays in alarm activation.

Human Friendly:
The frequency range in which humans can listen is 20Hz-20KHz whereas migratory birds and seagulls communicate almost exclusively in the ultrasonic range(above 20KHz). The alarm sounded is also in the ultrasonic range hence the humans nearby involved in oil cleaning are not disturbed and can perform their task without harsh alarms  that cause mental distress


Oil Spill Risk Mitigation:
WingShield's primary objective is to mitigate the risk of oil spills caused by birds landing in sensitive ocean areas. By sounding alarms and providing timely notifications, the model empowers decision-makers to deploy preventive measures and deter birds from hazardous landing zones.

User-Friendly Interface:
WingShield comes with an intuitive user interface that facilitates easy configuration, monitoring, and management. The interface allows users to visualize real-time bird detection data, configure alarm settings, and access historical records for further analysis.

Adaptability and Scalability:
The model is designed to be adaptable to various coastal ecosystems and scalable to accommodate different deployment scenarios. Whether protecting wildlife sanctuaries, industrial zones, or coastal habitats, WingShield can be customized to suit diverse environmental requirements.

Ethical Considerations:
WingShield is built with a strong ethical foundation, ensuring that bird detection and alarm activation are based solely on the well-being of the environment. The model minimizes false positives and prioritizes the conservation of avian species.
